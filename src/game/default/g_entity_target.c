 Emits a user-defined light when used. Lights can cycle between two colors,

 colors : The color(s) to cycle through (1 - 360 hue, "red", "green", "blue", etc..)
 delay : The delay before activating, in seconds (default 0).
 dmg : The radius of the light in units.
 targetname : The target name of this entity.
 wait : If specified, an additional cycle will fire after this interval.

 -------- Spawn flags --------
 start_on : The light starts on, with the first configured color.
 toggle : The light will include an off state in its cycle.

 -------- Notes --------
 Use this entity to add switched lights (toggle). Use the wait key to synchronize
 color cycles with other entities.

 Plays a sound each time it is used, or in loop if requested.

 noise : The name of the sample to play, e.g. voices/haunting.
 attenuation : The attenuation level; higher levels drop off more quickly (default 1):
   -1 : No attenuation, send the sound to the entire level.
    1 : Normal attenuation, hearable to all those in PHS of entity.
    2 : Idle attenuation, hearable only by those near to entity.
    3 : Static attenuation, hearable only by those very close to entity.
 targetname : The target name of this entity.

 -------- Spawn flags --------
 loop_on : The sound can be toggled, and will play in loop until used.
 loop_off : The sound can be toggled, and will begin playing when used.

 -------- Notes --------
 Use this entity only when a sound must be triggered by another entity. For
 all other ambient sounds, use misc_emit.
